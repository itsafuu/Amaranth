			    <h4>Searching Crypt</h4>

			    <p>Using keywords is the most effective form of searching. 

			    	For example: <strong>DOM obf</strong> will show all vampires with superior Dominate and inferior or superior Obfuscate.</p>

			    <p><strong>cel brujah</strong>  will show all Brujah vampires will Celerity &mdash; alternatively you could use the clan filter and select Brujah.</p> 

			    <p>Once you've filtered on keywords you can then use the filters to select the group or capacity.</p>
